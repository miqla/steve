            <h1>Steve Jobs</h1>
            <p>
              <b>Steven Paul Jobs</b> (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011). the
              founder of NeXT and chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar,
              and also co-founding the technology company Apple Inc. He and
              Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell
              Wozniak's Apple I personal computer.

          <h3>Founding of Apple</h3>
          <p>
            By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I
            computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it;
            Wozniak was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed. In
            April of that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer
            Ronald Wayne founded Apple Computer Company (now called "Apple
            Inc.") as a business partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home
            on April 1, 1976. The operation originally started in Jobs's bedroom
            and later moved to the garage. Wayne stayed briefly, leaving Jobs
            and Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two decided on the name "Apple" after Jobs returned from the All
            One Farm commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time in the
            farm's apple orchard. Jobs originally planned to produce bare
            printed circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer
            hobbyists for $50 (equivalent to about $280 in 2024) each. To fund
            the first batch, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator and Jobs
            sold his Volkswagen van. Later that year, computer retailer Paul
            Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled Apple I units for $500 each.
            Eventually, about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.

          <h3>NeXT and Pixar</h3>
          <p>
            Jobs quickly started another firm, NeXT Inc., designing powerful
            workstation computers for the education market. His funding partners
            included Texan entrepreneur Ross Perot and Canon Inc., a Japanese
            electronics company. Although the NeXT computer was notable for its
            engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from
            competitors such as Sun Microsystems, Inc. In the early 1990s Jobs
            focused the company on its innovative software system, NEXTSTEP.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in Pixar, a
            computer graphics firm that had been founded as a division of
            Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director
            George Lucas. Over the following decade Jobs built Pixar into a
            major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the
            first full-length feature film to be completely computer-animated,
            Toy Story, in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year made
            Jobs, for the first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the
            studio to the Disney Company in 2006.
